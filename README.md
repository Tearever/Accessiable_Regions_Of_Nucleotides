This project, completed for my Computing in Healthcare course, served as my introduction to machine learning and focused on predicting nucleotide accessibility using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal was to perform binary classification—determining whether a given nucleotide is accessible or not. We implemented and trained two different CNN models, experimenting with various hyperparameters to evaluate their performance. Model accuracy was tracked across epochs and visualized through plots. In addition, we generated a confusion matrix to analyze true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing a deeper understanding of each model’s predictive power and reliability.
